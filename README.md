# Bars4J - A simple, fast and effective way to include barcodes in java applications.
This project aims to create a java library for barcode creation. It is a revival of an old project I had at SourceForge, called JBarcode and now it has been renamed to Bars4J. The main features are support for a wide variety of standards, simplicity of including barcodes in Java applications and high performance with low memory consumption.
